				<h3>Biography</h3>
				<p>
					Howdy! I'm <strong> Benedict Arowojolu-Alagwe,</strong> and
					I am very passionate about solving problems, and
					development... be it human development, or environmental
					development, I'm just very passionate about growth. I've
					also got passion for computer and electrical engineering and
					a deep desire to understand how they work, especially in the
					realm of programming.<br />
					Which I'd say all started when I discovered the captivating
					world of video games. Little did I know that my love for
					gaming would become the gateway to my fascination with
					technology. What began as a pastime soon transformed into an
					insatiable quest for knowledge.
					<br />I want to unravel the mysteries of computers. So I've
					decided to embark on an exciting journey into the world of
					formal education by pursuing electrical engineering.I'm
					excited to explore the realm of programming, Currently I've
					got a good understanding of Python and JavaScript at the
					moment, and would love to learn a lower level language such
					as C++ or Assembly.
					<br />
					I do have hopes in being able to combine my programming
					skills with my electrical enginnering skills and maybe work
					as an Embedded developer, but that could easily change since
					I also delight in the idea of being a lawyer one way or
					another. But regardless of being a lawyer or not,
					programming is something I think i'd always be able make
					great to use of regardless of the niche.

				<h3>My goals here at altschool africa</h3>
				<p>
					My key goals in this course are to improve my skills as a
					backend developer and to broaden my professional network. I
					want to improve my skills in server-side programming and
					database management. At the same time, I'm very open to the
					idea of interacting with colleagues and mentors in order to
					establish a supportive professional network inside the tech
					business. This dual emphasis on skill development and
					networking I believe will direct my educational route here
					on altschool africa.
